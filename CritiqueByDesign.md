# Critique By Design
## STEP One: Find a data visualization.

## STEP Two: Critique the Visualization.
### Critique

Immediately, the colors of this visualization caught my eye. I found there to be some dissonance with the title and the nature of the report which seemed to cause alarm but the data did not prompt the same concern. i.	This figure does not do a good job of highlighting the fact that casualty rates are rising and that there is correlation with US troops being withdrawn from Afghanistan. If this report was anywhere else, like a really important policy briefing, I think that this chart would be completely overlooked. With that said, I found that the visualization color theme was neutral. It did not catch my attention right away. It was aesthetically pleasing and beautiful but the theme was poised to match the UNs logo.

Additionally, the text stood out to me right away. There are a lot of labels used in this visual and the color scheme made it a bit difficult to read some of the labels as well. I found this to be redundant overall. It pairs really well with the article which is trying to demonstrate that there was a spike in Afghan civilian casualties in May 2021 after a declining trend in casualties; however, the data is represented in years not months, but it shows that mid-year 2021 is on track to surpass 2020 and reverse the trend.

While I think the bar chart is an effective format, I do not think that the use of all of the labels was effective. I think it distracted from the overall message that the chart was trying to convey. The information presented in the chart is easy to understand, but the chart itself does not reflect or highlight the data that the article is referring to. The article wants to highlight that there was a spike in casualty deaths as US troops have been deployed from Afghanistan. The data collected for 2021 is only half complete. But this information is not highlighted in the actual visualization.

This figure does not do a good job of highlighting the fact that casualty rates are rising and that there is correlation with US troops being withdrawn from Afghanistan. If this report was anywhere else, like a really important policy briefing, I think that this chart would be completely overlooked.In terms of recommendations, first, I would combine injuries and deaths into a total category and depict that instead. I would do this because, as an audience member, I care about the big picture. I want to know what the overall trend is and how it correlates to removing troops from Afghanistan. Because this is a UN report, the colors that show distinction follow a UN color palette theme. I think this doesn’t do the cause justice because the numbers are alarming and I want to depict that. Secondly, I would add a color scheme that would show the natural progression and degression of the casualty rates. I think that the color scheme is not effective in this context. It just seems like something that is going to be memorialized in a report and nothing more. 

Overall, I don't mind this visualization but I do not think it properly does the situation justice. The data collected for 2021 is only up to June. As someone points out in the user feedback, this data foreshadows the mass casualties at the hands of the Taliban as the US withdrew from Afghanistan just a few months later and the article was published before the withdrawal. Initially, a part of me wonders how this data, had it been made public, would have had the potential to sway public opinion at the onset of the withdarawal that would have prompted a slower exit. 


## STEP Three: Wireframe a solution.
#### Wireframe sketch.

#### Explanation 

## STEP Four: Test the solution. 
I sent the wireframe drawing to 5 users ranging between the ages of 21-35. I received feedback from 4 individuals in time for submission. I sent this alongside a worksheet with the questions discussed later. No background or context on the data was provided. The feedback is listed below. 

### User Feedback
#### Question 1: Can you tell me what you think this is?
User 1: *Both graphs are showing the number of Afghanistan civilian casualties.*

User 2: *2 charts showing casualty history in Afghanistan.*

User 3: *Shows number of Afghans killed each year and only up to June for 2021.*

User 4: *These are two similar bar charts, and you are showing data on the number of Afghan casualties in both but in the second one, there are two bars to show injuries and deaths.*

#### Question 2: Can you describe to me waht this is telling you?
User 1: *First graph shows the number of Afghanistan casualties drastically decline from 2016-21 vs. 2019-2021. The second shows the number of casualties peaked until 2016, declined from 2018-2020 and then peaked again in 2021.*

User 2: *Significant increase in casualties after a dip in 2018/2019.*

User 3: *It is telling me how many Afghans have been killed.*

User 4: *It looks like you’re trying to show that 2021 is a big year for casualties. I only know this from looking at the first model. The second model shows that the numbers are increasing in 2021 but it doesn’t stand out.*

#### Question 3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
User 1: *Is there a relationship between the two charts? The second seems to be a broken down version of the first.*

User 2: *Casualties increasing after troops leave.*

User 3: *Why isn’t the top in chronological order?*

User 4: *It’s surprising how there appears to be a decline until 2021.*

#### Question 4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
User 1: *Anyone reading the news or searching for the number of Afghanistan civilian casualties.*

User 2: *Anyone*

User 3: *Wide audience but looks like UN data. May politicians or policymakers?*

User 4: *I would imagine anyone that can read a bar chart. This looks simple and it’s straightforward. I suppose thought it would be intended for anyone who actually knows what a “casualty” is.* 

#### Question 5: Is there anything you would do differently?
User 1: *Remove the 2021 bar in orange from the top graph.*

User 2: *Organize the data chronologically and add data labels.*

User 3: *I wouldn’t separate the data in the bottom sketch. I like the concept of one bar.*

User 4: *I really like how the bar chart is horizontal in the first model. I don’t think you need to differentiate between the types of casualties. I think I generally like the first one more.  Definitely highlight 2021 because I see that there’s a declining trend that is increasing because of deployment and this could have served as good foreshadowing before we deployed US troops.*

#### Reflection
I was immediately relieved that all of my users were able to understand what I was trying to convey in each of the charts. I was persoanlly conflicted with whether or not I wanted to combine the data into a single chart, thereby simplifying the overall data, or if I wanted to distinguish between *deaths* and *injuries*. Ultimately, the general consensus was that peoeple preferred to see the data simplified. Additional feedback I received was that anyone could look at the way the data was presented and understand it. This conveyed that while the data was simple and somewhat trimmed down, it was still effective. I decided to keep the simple model in my subsequent drafts. 

I was surprised to hear that people were taken aback by the ranking order. I had a couple of users ask to see the same data presented chronologically. In the end, I decided to present the day chornologically because I felt that there was a trend that was also important to highlight and the fact that 2021 is the last data point on the chart still caused some immediate alarm and was more effective used in this way than tucking it away at 4th place. 

I decided on the warm color scheme because I wanted to show variation. I also think the way the data was presented chronologically still highlighted the year 2021 because it was a big red bar following a decreasing trend. Again, this demonstrated that there was a decreasing trend that users were able to pick up on and I did not feel the need to explicitly call it out.
