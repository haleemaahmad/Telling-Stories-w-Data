## STEP Two: Critique the Visualization.

#### Explanation 

## STEP Four: Test the solution. 

#### Question 1: Can you tell me what you think this is?
User 1: Both graphs are showing the number of Afghanistan civilian casualties.
User 2:2 charts showing casualty history in Afghanistan.
User 3: Shows number of Afghans killed each year and only up to June for 2021.
User 4: These are two similar bar charts, and you are showing data on the number of Afghan casualties in both but in the second one, there are two bars to show injuries and deaths.

#### Question 2: Can you describe to me waht this is telling you?
User 1: First graph shows the number of Afghanistan casualties drastically decline from 2016-21 vs. 2019-2021. The second shows the number of casualties peaked until 2016, declined from 2018-2020 and then peaked again in 2021.
User 2:Significant increase in casualties after a dip in 2018/2019.
User 3: It is telling me how many Afghans have been killed.
User 4: It looks like you’re trying to show that 2021 is a big year for casualties. I only know this from looking at the first model. The second model shows that the numbers are increasing in 2021 but it doesn’t stand out.

#### Question 3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
User 1: Is there a relationship between the two charts? The second seems to be a broken down version of the first.
User 2: Casualties increasing after troops leave.
User 3: Why isn’t the top in chronological order?
User 4: It’s surprising how there appears to be a decline until 2021.

#### Question 4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
User 1: Anyone reading the news or searching for the number of Afghanistan civilian casualties.
User 2: Anyone
User 3: Wide audience but looks like UN data. May politicians or policymakers?
User 4: I would imagine anyone that can read a bar chart. This looks simple and it’s straightforward. I suppose thought it would be intended for anyone who actually knows what a “casualty” is. 

#### Question 5: Is there anything you would do differently?
User 1: Remove the 2021 bar in orange from the top graph.
User 2: Organize the data chronologically and add data labels.
User 3: I wouldn’t separate the data in the bottom sketch. I like the concept of one bar.
User 4: I really like how the bar chart is horizontal in the first model. I don’t think you need to differentiate between the types of casualties. I think I generally like the first one more.  Definitely highlight 2021 because I see that there’s a declining trend that is increasing because of deployment and this could have served as good foreshadowing before we deployed US troops.
