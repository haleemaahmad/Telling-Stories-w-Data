# **Lebanon: How a Ponzi Scheme Led to Lebanon's Financial Meltdown**
For my final project, I have decided to tell the story of the Lebanese financial crisis. I have been following this situation very closely over the last year and the tragic thing is that although it doesn't seem like it could get any worse for Lebanon, there have been significant events that have worsened the situation for the Lebanese citizens. In my outline below, I have chosen key events that I want to expand on for my story. 

### **Overview**
#### 1. Ponzi Scheme
How the Lebanese central government convinced foreign investors to bank in Lebanon and how the instability of the Arab spring forced investors to pull their money out of Lebanon - leading to a financial crisis. 

#### 2. COVID-19
This section will show the devastation as brought on by COVID-19 in the midst of a critical financial crisis. I want to show how COVID-19 disrupted tourism in Lebanon, critical to the countrys stability, which led to a worsening financial situation. 

#### 3. Beirut Blast
At the peak of the financial crisis, negligence resulted in the Beirut blast, killing hundreds, injuring thousands and exacerbating a very critical situation. 

#### 4. Civil War in the 21st Century
The friction of the finanical situation and the rivaling religious governmental factions led to a violent standoff in October 2021. In this section, I hope that the situation will be presented as dire. 

#### 5. Implications for Middle East Stability
This section will explore how middle east relations could be strained and how dire it is to restore stability through global finacial intervention. I want to use this section to show people that there are real consequences such as bigger gloabl refugee crisis or increased tensions among key playsers in the region. 

#### 6. How to help
Links that people can follow if they want to donate to help a cause in Lebanon. I want to bring awareness to the situation and help people understand how critical the situation is and how they can help. I hope that by bringing awareness to this crisis, we can help do something to stop another global refugee crisis and restore some stability in the Middle East before the situation gets worse.

4. Middle East Comparison
+ [MENA Financial Data](Data/MENA Finance Data.xlsx)

In order to encapsulate the financial situation in Lebanon, I have needed to scout multip reputable financial data files. I have extraced most of this data from the World Bank and World Bank affiliate sites, such as WITS (world Integrated Trade Solution) data. I have collected data on hunger and poverty in Lebanon which will support an analysis on scarcity and inflation. Additionally, as I discussed above, COVID-19 had a significant impact on Lebanon's tourism sector - one of the last remaining industries in Lebanon. This has severely impacted GDP and so I have collected GDP data to demonstrate the financial disparities in Lebanon as well. I have also collected comporable data on the neighborhing middle eastern countries to show a comparison to both war torn countries and prospering oil-rich countries in the region. 


### **Method and Medium**
I will be using Shorthand to complete my project. I believe this is the best platform, for this story in particular, because it is a very dark and emotional situation. Throughout the entire story, I want to be able to evoke emotions from the audience that will help them understand how grave the situation is. In drafting, I have realized that a key threading element is the corruption in the Lebanese government. I would like to leverage this and use it as a theme to tell the story. In order to do this, I will use Tableau and Flourish to present data series and show how quickly the situation in Lebanon declined. Finally, I will use this platform to show people how they can help as well.
