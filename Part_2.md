# **Final Project Wireframes/Storyboards & User Research**

### **Storybaords**
For this part, I decided to start building my storyboards with [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/GTJGVgN8AGG8TgSj). 

Between the user research and the actual building, I was finally able to better picture how I wanted to tell the story of the Lebanese financial crisis. In fact, I piovted so instead of focusing on just the Ponzi scheme or the financial crisis itself, I was able to intertwine it with the unraveling humanitarian crisis.
