# **Final Project Wireframes/Storyboards & User Research**

### **Storybaords**
For this part, I decided to start building my storyboards with [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/GTJGVgN8AGG8TgSj). 

Between the user research and the actual building, I was finally able to better picture how I wanted to tell the story of the Lebanese financial crisis. In fact, I piovted so instead of focusing on just the Ponzi scheme or the financial crisis itself, I was able to intertwine it with the unraveling humanitarian crisis. 


### **User Research**


#### **Research Protocol**


#### **The Problem**
How might we spread awareness using data and visualizations about the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon right now?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81713787/143170207-468ff617-302e-46b1-8062-b7dec80391a8.png)


#### **Objective**
This project aims to inform and educate young adults on the very pressing and real issues faced by the Lebanese people today. This project aims to prompt young adults to engage with politics and economics on a global scale by looking at Lebanon and seeing how corruption has lent itself to a failing state. Ultimately, this project aims to bring awareness to real issues in a part of the world that the global society has come to inevitably consider problematic and riddled with conflict.


#### **Users**
This presentation is intended for young adults that have either obtained or are working on their college degrees. They need not to have a fluency in data analysis but should be able to understand a graphic and basic economic concepts such as gross domestic product (GDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), Gini coefficient and implications associated with trends of each.
