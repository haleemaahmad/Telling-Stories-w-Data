# **Final Project Part 2: Wireframes/Storyboards & User Research**

## **Storybaords**
For this part, I decided to start building my storyboards with [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/GTJGVgN8AGG8TgSj). 

Between the user research and the actual building, I was finally able to better picture how I wanted to tell the story of the Lebanese financial crisis. In fact, I piovted so instead of focusing on just the Ponzi scheme or the financial crisis itself, I was able to intertwine it with the unraveling humanitarian crisis.

## **User Research**


### **Research Protocol**
The users interviewed are all happened to be college educated, young adults, ages 19-35, with an even mix of male and female.
All users were sent the link to the storyboard and asked to review before meeting and discussing with me over zoom or the telephone. All users kept the 


### **The Problem**
How might we spread awareness using data and visualizations about the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon right now?


### **Target Audience**
This project aims to inform and educate young adults on the very pressing and real issues faced by the Lebanese people today. This project aims to prompt young adults to engage with politics and economics on a global scale by looking at Lebanon and seeing how corruption has lent itself to a failing state. Ultimately, this project aims to bring awareness to real issues in a part of the world that the global society has come to inevitably consider problematic and riddled with conflict.


### **Representative Users**
This presentation is intended for young adults that have either obtained or are working on their college degrees. They need not to have a fluency in data analysis but should be able to understand a graphic and basic economic concepts such as gross domestic product (GDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), Gini coefficient and implications associated with trends of each.

### **Key Insights**
***Question 1***: Did you get a chance to review the shorthand presentation I shared with you? Was it easy to navigate?
+ “So cool! And very easy to navigate.”
+ “I’ve never seen anything like this. It was interesting.”

***Question 2***: How much did you know about the Lebanese financial crisis before seeing this presentation?
+ “I was aware of the crisis but had no visibility to detailed numbers.”
+ “I knew about it but something is always going on in the Middle East. I’m not always completely aware of what exactly is happening.”
+ “I’ve been reading a lot about Lebanon lately especially because of the volent clashes between the Christians and Hezbollah last month. Basically I know something is going on but I never thought to pull up economic data.”

***Question 3***:  How likely are you to click on any of the external links as part of the call to action?
+ “I could use some more convincing, if I’m being honest.”
+ “I’m definitely more likely to donate now than I was before.”
+ “Honestly, if I was sure this money was going to get into the right hands, without a doubt, I would donate.”

***Question 4***: For these next few questions, I want to get a good understanding of what worked for you in the overall presentation. What worked well and what excited you about the presentation? 
+ “I really liked the use of data and details. You used a lot of visuals that I thought were appealing. The graphics and charts helped me understand the significant decline in recent years. Also, the overall economical situation of a country in distress.”
+ “The visuals were great. I think the order that you presented this in was effective. I also really liked the interactive line graph – did you do that on purpose?”
+ “I like the charts. I they’re really easy to understand. I know you’re drafting but the placeholders are effective too. It makes me excited to see the finished product.”

***Question 5***: What did you value the most about this presentation?
+ “I would say that portrayal of the economic crisis was the most valuable.”
+ “I think the use of graphics is good. In particular, the religious contrast – that one section where you go from a Muslim man praying to a cross and then to bullets is really powerful.”

***Question 6***: What resonated with you the most about this presentation?
+ “I guess I didn’t really understand that this was a worsening situation. I’m thinking about this a lot more now and I think I’ll definitely be more mindful of seeing it on the news.”
+ “The economy is one thing but you caught me off guard with the religious tensions. I definitely think you should expand on this.”

***Question 7***: Now I would like to know what did not necessarily work for you. What did you not like about the presentation?
+ “I wouldn’t say that something didn’t necessarily work. There are just some areas that I want to see more of.”
+ “Given the situation, I think you could have used photos that are a big more powerful. It looks like you used a bunch of Instagram photos for this. I want to see something more raw!”

***Question 8***: What would you change about the presentation?
+ “I would add more photos and data.”
+ “Will you be explaining the graphics and data more?”

***Question 9***: Do you have any suggestions for improvement?
+ “This is kind of dark. Add a warning maybe.”

***Question 10***: What do you think will make this presentation better?
+ “Add more COVID-related data and impact compared to other countries.”
+ “I want to see more sociological impact like how many people have fled the country, especially young people. Is there an impact on school dropout rates? You should include this. What about suicide rates? I would assume there is a direct correlation with mental health. As dark as this is, I think if you’re trying to raise awareness, this is an important element to consider adding to your presentation.”

***Question 11***: These next few questions are aimed to understand your thought process while viewing the presentation. What questions came up while you were viewing the content? 

***Question 12***: What needs further investigation? 
+ “I found myself wondering why some items had higher rates of inflation than others. Do you think you could add something supplemental to support this? Maybe some trade data?”
+ “I am curious about the unemployment rate. I was expecting it to be worse than it is. Can you talk more about why this is significant even if it hasn’t reached historical levels?”

***Question 13***: What made you curious?
+ “Overall, all of the data made me want to see more. It’s simple and straightforward. I Just want to know more about the situation.”

***Question 14***: We’re wrapping up with the questions now. I just want to know what, if any, new inspirations arose? 
+ “I just want to see more data. I like what you’ve done here but I think you need to add more data. Even interactive data is really cool and it would help the audience engage more with this.”

***Question 15***: What surprised you about this presentation?
+ “I’m surprised that the presentation held my attention. When it comes to data, I get bored easily and I tend to scroll through it more quickly but this was interesting and kept me engaged.”
+ “When you said financial and economic data, I was hesitant honestly, but this was easy to understand.”
+ “This presentation made me sad.”

***Question 16***: What would you like to see differently? 
+ “I don’t think I’d like to see anything differently. I just want to see more.”
+ “Again, I want to see more sociological impact. I think that’ll invoke a lot more emotion.”

***Question 17***: Do you have any additional comments or feedback?
+ “I think the links you provide at the end are powerful. It makes me feel like I can do something about this and not just walk away from it feeling sad and defeated.”
