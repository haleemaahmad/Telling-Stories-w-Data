## Part 3: Final Project & Presentation

#### Summary of **Changes**

***Storyline:*** My biggest dilemma throughout this entire project presentation was figuring out how to boil it all down to a single story. Repeatedly, I had gotten feedback that I was trying to say too much at once or that all of the data was overwhelming. I found myself sharing the same sentiments but I was committed to making it work because I knew without all of the main pieces - something would be missing. Then, it came to me. The reason all of those moving parts - the financial crisis, COVID-19, Beirut Blast - were all important was because they told the story of a humanitarian crisis unraveling at the seams in Lebanon. This clarity helped me nail down the final storyline. 

***Financial & Economic Data:*** I could have made this entire presentation on the state-sanctioned Lebanese Ponzi Scheme but decided to I would opt to show financial data that had direct implications for the worsening humanitarian crisis. In my storyboards, I chose to show FDI and unemployment rates in Lebanon, but user feedback indicated that debt and more explanation as to inflation would be more compelling. In class critiques, it was also recommended to use annotations on the charts to indicate significant events in Lebanon's history. 

***COVID-19 Data:*** The users I interviewed wanted to see more data to that would show how bad the COVID-19 situation is in Lebanon. To incorporate this and kind of break up the mundane financial data that I had includeded in the financial crisis section, I decided to create an interactive bar chart that would show new cases as well as cumulative deaths. I chose this because it would allow people to play around with the chart and see how much worse the situation got despite (futile) vaccination efforts. 

***Port of Beirut:*** I found it challenging to show the magnitude of the Beirut blast and how much impact it had on the Lebanese economic and humanitarian situation. I saw that Flourish had an option for users to create a coursel of cards. After playing around with it, I found that the data was nicely displayed and would embed really well into my storyboard. 

***Refugee Crisis:*** One of my users asked me why Lebanon was any different from Syria, Iraq, or Palestine and I realized that, in fact, people could very well be jaded by yet another conflict in the Middle East. However, the Middle East is so unstable right now that Lebanon and Jordan are holding the region together and have absorbed a significant number of the refugees from neighboring conflicts. The current refugee crisis is a global crisis and the Arab states have absorbed the brunt of it. I had to find a way to convey that a failing Lebanese state would result in extreme conflict and crisis that would impact the entire world. 

***Call to Action:*** The final change I made was find more well-known agencies that people could donate to, if they felt compelled to, after the presentation. A few of my users seemed skeptical of the resources I had provided in my storyboards so I included links to the UN and Human Rights Watch, in addition to Lebanese NGOs.

## **Intended Audience**
As intended, the audience for this project are young adults interested in being educated on the very pressing and real issues faced by the Lebanese people today and the greater implications for Middle East stability. This project aims to prompt young adults to engage with politics and economics on a global scale by looking at Lebanon and seeing how financial corruption has lent itself to a humanitarian crisis.  

## **Final Story**
Lebanon has been regarded as the "Switzerland of the Middle East." It's geographic location comes fully equipped with geopolitics; however, in the midst of seemingly neverending conflict in the region, Lebanon has also served as a sanctuary for refugees. On a personal note, it has been really sad to observe the unraveling of the Middle East and watch Lebanon crumble at the hands of government mismanagement and corruption as well as watch how this corruption has set the stage for crises to thrive, at the expense of innocent people. 

It was my intention to set the stage for how corruption in the government created a devastating financial crisis that paved the way for COVID-19 spread all over the country. This situation was exacerbated by the Port of Beirut explosion in the summer of 2020 that made a crippling financial situation even worse by destorying Lebanon's ability to import necessary goods. Finally, another element of this situation is the global refugee crisis. At the start of the Palestinian conflict in the 20th century, Palestinians were forced to seek asylum in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. When the US war in Iraq started, Iraqi refugees were forced to seek asylum in neighboring countries such as Lebanon and Syria. And at the onset of the Syrian civil war, formerly displaced refugees from Palestine and Iraq were forced to settle in Lebanon with their newly displaced Syrian coutnerparts. A failing Lebanese state could have devastating global implications. While it feels like there's little that can be done, it is so important to not only raise awareness of this issue and its magnitude, but also help, if we can.
