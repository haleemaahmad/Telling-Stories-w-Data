## Part 3: Final Project & Presentation

#### Summary

**Changes**

+ Storyline.
My biggest dilemma throughout this entire project presentation was figuring out how to boil it all down to a single story. Repeatedly, I had gotten feedback that I was trying to say too much at once or that all of the data was overwhelming. I found myself sharing the same sentiments but I was committed to making it work because I knew without all of the main pieces - something would be missing. Then, it came to me. The reason all of those moving parts - the financial crisis, COVID-19, Beirut Blast - were all important was because they told the story of a humanitarian crisis unraveling at the seams in Lebanon. This clarity helped me nail down the final storyline. 

+ Financial & Economic Data
I could have made this entire presentation on the state-sanctioned Lebanese Ponzi Scheme but decided to I would opt to show financial data that had direct implications for the worsening humanitarian crisis. In my storyboards, I chose to show FDI and unemployment rates in Lebanon, but user feedback indicated that debt and more explanation as to inflation would be more compelling. In class critiques, it was also recommended to use annotations on the charts to indicate significant events in Lebanon's history.
