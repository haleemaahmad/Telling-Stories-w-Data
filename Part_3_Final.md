## Part 3: Final Project & Presentation

#### Summary of **Changes**

***Storyline:*** My biggest dilemma throughout this entire project presentation was figuring out how to boil it all down to a single story. Repeatedly, I had gotten feedback that I was trying to say too much at once or that all of the data was overwhelming. I found myself sharing the same sentiments but I was committed to making it work because I knew without all of the main pieces - something would be missing. Then, it came to me. The reason all of those moving parts - the financial crisis, COVID-19, Beirut Blast - were all important was because they told the story of a humanitarian crisis unraveling at the seams in Lebanon. This clarity helped me nail down the final storyline. 

***Financial & Economic Data:*** I could have made this entire presentation on the state-sanctioned Lebanese Ponzi Scheme but decided to I would opt to show financial data that had direct implications for the worsening humanitarian crisis. In my storyboards, I chose to show FDI and unemployment rates in Lebanon, but user feedback indicated that debt and more explanation as to inflation would be more compelling. In class critiques, it was also recommended to use annotations on the charts to indicate significant events in Lebanon's history. 

***COVID-19 Data:*** The users I interviewed wanted to see more data to that would show how bad the COVID-19 situation is in Lebanon. To incorporate this and kind of break up the mundane financial data that I had includeded in the financial crisis section, I decided to create an interactive bar chart that would show new cases as well as cumulative deaths. I chose this because it would allow people to play around with the chart and see how much worse the situation got despite (futile) vaccination efforts. 

***Port of Beirut:*** I found it challenging to show the magnitude of the Beirut blast and how much impact it had on the Lebanese economic and humanitarian situation. I saw that Flourish had an option for users to create a coursel of cards. After playing around with it, I found that the data was nicely displayed and would embed really well into my storyboard. 

***Refugee Crisis:*** One of my users asked me why Lebanon was any different from Syria, Iraq, or Palestine and I realized that, in fact, people could very well be jaded by yet another conflict in the Middle East. However, the Middle East is so unstable right now that Lebanon and Jordan are holding the region together and have absorbed a significant number of the refugees from neighboring conflicts. The current refugee crisis is a global crisis and the Arab states have absorbed the brunt of it. I had to find a way to convey that a failing Lebanese state would result in extreme conflict and crisis that would impact the entire world. 

***Call to Action:*** The final change I made was find more well-known agencies that people could donate to, if they felt compelled to, after the presentation. A few of my users seemed skeptical of the resources I had provided in my storyboards so I included links to the UN and Human Rights Watch, in addition to Lebanese NGOs.
