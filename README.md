# About Me
Hi Everyone! My name is Haleema Ahmad (she/her). I'm currently a 2nd year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management with a concentration in economic development. 
I am originally from Chicago, which is where I grew up, attended college, and established my career prior to moving to Pittsburgh for CMU. Previously I worked in global regulatory affairs which meant that most of my life involved reading and interpreting device regulations. Being in a position where I could compare regulations, language, and governance peaked my interest in policymaking. I was also in a unique position given my international studies background where I was able to correlate the strength of the governing bodies with the degree of development in the respective countries. Three years later, I found myself at Heinz learning how policies are made. I hope to work in the sphere of social and economic development to help reinvigorate struggling communities through effective policymaking. 

## What I Hope to Learn
I want to learn everything. Data, art, coding - it's all a little bit intimidating for me. So, I hope I can face these challenges head on, learn how to take data and communicate it in a concise and visually appealing way and successfully demonstrate that with this portfolio. I certainly want to refine these skills and I want to be able to use them post-Heinz. 

## What I Have Learned
I learned a lot from this course and it's been really exciting to learn how to take data, trim it down, find trends, and present those trends in visual ways that appeal to will garner the right emotions from the audience. I'm glad that we got to learn how to work with data visualization tools such as Flourish and Tableau. In my final project, I tried to incorporate a variety of visuals, as we practiced in class, while keeping color theory in mind, to make them somewhat interactive and ensure that my audience was engaged. Being able to take that work and embed it into a Github as well as on my Shorthand final project pages was a really effective way of practicing how to do something in a variety of different ways. In looking back now, I can see that we were able to get ample experience in the new concpets we learned. T
