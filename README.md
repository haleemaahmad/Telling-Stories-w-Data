# About Me
Hi Everyone! My name is Haleema Ahmad (she/her). I'm currently a 2nd year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management with a concentration in economic development. 
I am originally from Chicago, which is where I grew up, attended college, and established my career prior to moving to Pittsburgh for CMU. Previously I worked in global regulatory affairs which meant that most of my life involved reading and interpreting device regulations. Being in a position where I could compare regulations, language, and governance peaked my interest in policymaking. I was also in a unique position given my international studies background where I was able to correlate the strength of the governing bodies with the degree of development in the respective countries. Three years later, I found myself at Heinz learning how policies are made. I hope to work in the sphere of social and economic development to help reinvigorate struggling communities through effective policymaking. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I want to learn everything. Data, art, coding - it's all a little bit intimidating for me. So, I hope I can face these challenges head on, learn how to take data and communicate it in a concise and visually appealing way and successfully demonstrate that with this portfolio. I certainly want to refine these skills and I want to be able to use them post-Heinz.

This is where I will be showcasing what I learn in Telling Stories with Data. Check back soon!


# Government Debt
This a test to see how well I can follow directions. If you're able to see the chart detailing global government debt as a percentage of GDP, then I did alright. If you can't, well...it's all up from here, right?

## Government Debt Vizualized in Sparklines and Chart
This is the same debt but it is demonstrated in sparkline charts so you can see fluctuations between 1995-2019 for each of the countries.
