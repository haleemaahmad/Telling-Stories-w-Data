# About Me
Hi Everyone! My name is Haleema Ahmad (she/her). I'm currently a 2nd year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management with a concentration in economic development. 
I am originally from Chicago, which is where I grew up, attended college, and established my career prior to moving to Pittsburgh for CMU. Previously I worked in global regulatory affairs which meant that most of my life involved reading and interpreting device regulations. Being in a position where I could compare regulations, language, and governance peaked my interest in policymaking. I was also in a unique position given my international studies background where I was able to correlate the strength of the governing bodies with the degree of development in the respective countries. Three years later, I found myself at Heinz learning how policies are made. I hope to work in the sphere of social and economic development to help reinvigorate struggling communities through effective policymaking. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I want to learn everything. Data, art, coding - it's all a little bit intimidating for me. So, I hope I can face these challenges head on, learn how to take data and communicate it in a concise and visually appealing way and successfully demonstrate that with this portfolio. I certainly want to refine these skills and I want to be able to use them post-Heinz.

## Projects
[Visualizing Government Debt](GovernmentDebt.md)

# Government Debt
Below is an overview overview of government debt as a percentage of GDP, displayed in a bar chart. This debt shows 2020 government debt for global economies that is organized from lowest to highest ratios.

## Government Debt Visualized in Sparklines Charts
Government debt is not incurred overnight. This is the same debt but it is demonstrated in sparkline charts so you can see fluctuations between 1995-2019 for each of the countries that shows some history that leads us to our original bar chart that only shows ratios for 2020. We use sparklines because it helps us visualize the debt in a time series, and the grid helps us compare different countries at a glance.

## Government Debt Visualized as Mass in Area Charts
Now if that isn't alarming, here is the same data, but this time, it is portrayed in an area chart for each of the countries listed above. While we still see the trends that are emerging, the area chart gives us a greater sense of the trends demonstrated above. Below, you can see the same trends as in the sparkline charts, but you can also better visualize the mass of the debts

### Visualizing Data
All three charts above help us tell as story about data. The bar chart is simple, and to the point. It also compares the data of various global economies; however, it also only demonstrates data for one single year. The sparklines give us an opportunity to see the same sort of data, but displayed in a way that helps us look at countries one by one and it makes easy to compare them to one another. With the same axes and scales, we are able to take a quick glance and figure out which countries have lower debts and which ones stand out. Unlike the bar chart, we can see a time series with this data as well. 
I chose the area chart because what was missing from the sparklines is the magnitude of the debt that the bar chart was able to demonstrate. I felt that I was able to tie in this shock factor by showing mass with the area chart. I chose to portray this data in red because the bigger masses are more easily identifiable. My eyes go straight to Japan the same way they did in the bar chart. Curating the data in this form helps tell a multi-dimensional story. It isn't just a snapshot, like the bar graph, and while it shows change over time like the sparklines, the area chart catches the attention of the audience and tells a story of surmounting debt that the other charts could not do.
